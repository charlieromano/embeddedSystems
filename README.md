Embedded Software, Embedded Systems, Software Engineering, Pattern Design


## Goals

1. I want to apply finite state machines, active objects and hardware related handlers, like pattern designs, using Python.

2. I want to build a cannonical software example for getting guidelines in the software development process, including hot fixes, branching (dev, test, prod)versioning, and releases, using Github.

3. I want to test frameworks for testing driven development using Python.

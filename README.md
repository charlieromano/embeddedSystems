# Embedded Systems
Embedded Systems, Software Engineering, Pattern Design


## Goals

1. I want to apply finite state machines, active objects and hardware related handlers, like pattern designs, using C, freeRTOS, Bash and Python.
2. I want to apply good practices in this repo, including branches (dev, test, prod), versioning, hot fixes, releases, etc.
3. I want to deploy code in ESP32, ST32-NUCLEO and Raspberry Pi platforms so I can build distributed embedded platforms.
